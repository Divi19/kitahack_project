# Kitahack_project

A new Flutter project based on an application for detecting problems with solar panels, and helps to track the efficiency levels along with fixing such problems.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Features

- Real-time detection of various factors such as the intergrity of panels, their efficiency, their power usages, solar radiation levels , risk percentages of the panels the and chance for unfavorable weather conditions.
- Predicitve data to help predict the efficiency of the panels over a span of time and plots a graph to show it in a more intuitive way.
- Notifications tab to help alert the user when the panel has recieved any forms of damage that might cause detriment to its efficiency, and it can alert users that maintainance is required. Other alerts may me raised for possible dirt or unfavorable weather conditions arriving that might hamper the efficiency of the panels in some way.
- Settings tab for the user to edit profile, change password, change some preferences in the app or its appearance. It also includes the provacy policy and terms of service

- Open up the device emulator through VS Code
- Run the main.dart file without debugging by right-clicking the main file
- Wait a few moments till the flutter app runs on the emulator in order to view the project
- Chanage the sdk.dir in your local.properties file to match with the location that your sdk file is stored
